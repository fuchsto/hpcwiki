# Message Passing

A comprehensive literature review on parallel computing would confront you with a
mind-numbingly vast, unstructured terminology. Boiled down to their essence, only a few
fundamental models remain that actually differ in expressiveness.
These are periodically rediscovered, reimplemented and - just to confuse the russians -
renamed.
Message passing is also known as *Actor Model*, *Communicating Sequential Processes* or
*Process Channels*. These terms each have their specific connotation but they just
emphasize different aspects of the same basic idea.

As of this writing, the cool kids on the block use Go and praise its elegant, robust
and efficient concurrency features, namely *goroutines*. Way better than the restrictive
event model! A few years earlier, Scala had its 15 minutes of fame. Both seem short-lived
compared to Erlang which is established in the TelCo industry for decades.
Seasoned academics admire Smalltalk, the legendary Yggdrasil of programming languages.

Message passing. All of them.
