# Memory and Storage

![A real-life storage; sitting or standing on the pallet jack as illustrated here is highly prohibited by operational safety guidelines (and also the only way they are actually used)](/lab/session-03/warehouse.jpg)

So you might have noticed we sometimes refer to memory as "storage" (see the picture in this paragraph remember what a storage is in real life).

In my youngling days I worked in a warehouse as "logistics assistant". So I was schlepping paletts of beverages and potatos using a transportation device (Niederflurhubwagen, aka "Ameise") capable of moving exactly one pallet.
You wouldn't carry single bottles around. You always move a full pallet, of course. And there is only one kind of product per pallet.
