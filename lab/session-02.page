# Terminology

Consider this simple C snippet:

~~~c
int a = 12;
int b = 23;
// ...
a += b;
~~~

The expression `a += b` is an **operation** applied to `a` with\
argument `b` as its only argument.

Note that the term **parameter** refers to a variable in a function's
signature while an **argument** is a concrete value.
For Example:

~~~c
int confabulate(double d, int i);
// ...
confabulate(2.124, 41.99);
~~~

The variable `double d` is a parameter of function `confabulate`
which is then called with arguments `2.124` and `41.99.
