# Why C?

To keep the material on an abstract level that will stay relevant for decades,
we focus on computational principles in hardware and programming models, not
programming.

For the HPC domain in system programming, the only viable choices are C, C++
and Fortran. To implement HPC applications in the real world, we recommend C++.
The use cases in the lab assignments do not require expertise in high-level
programming abstractions and assume a basic understanding of C.

If you are proficient in C++, we encourage you to use it in lab assignments to
achieve more elegant solutions.
