# Why C?

To keep the material on an abstract level that will stay relevant for decades,
we focus on computational principles in hardware and programming models, not
programming.

For the HPC domain in system programming, the only viable choices are C, C++
and Fortran. The use cases in the lab assignments do not require expertise in
high-level programming abstractions. To implement HPC applications in the real
world, we recommend C++.
